## Introduction

This project aims to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their specifications. It utilizes machine learning models, including a neural network and a decision tree, to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various mobile phone features and their corresponding price ranges. The features include battery power, Bluetooth, clock speed, dual SIM support, front camera mega pixels, 4G support, internal memory, mobile depth, weight, number of processor cores, primary camera mega pixels, pixel resolution, RAM, screen height and width, talk time, 3G support, touch screen, and Wi-Fi.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the mobile-price-prediction.ipynb notebook and run the cells to see the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

The project includes two models: a neural network and a decision tree. The models are evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The decision tree model achieves higher accuracy compared to the neural network model.
